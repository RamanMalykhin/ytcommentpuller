This is an attempt to pull Youtube comments using Python.

Current version is using the public API.

Todo: 
- Refactor into a proper .py script
- Investigate why on >200 comments the script is not pulling all (suspect pagination is implemented wrongly)
- re https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/134912604?pli=1#comment3 - may be shifing to a fully webscraped approach will be more reliable
